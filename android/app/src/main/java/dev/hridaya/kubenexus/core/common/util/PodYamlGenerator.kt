/**
 * Renders the reviewed manifest for the guided Pod creation flow as
 * deterministic YAML.
 *
 * The generated text is exactly what gets applied: the user reviews this
 * string, and the same string is sent through the bridge, so what is shown is
 * never out of sync with what is created. The manifest is assembled as an
 * ordered structure and serialized by yamlkt's dynamic block-style encoder,
 * which preserves key order instead of relying on hand-appended lines. The
 * [PodDraft.containerPort] is omittable because a bare container needs no port
 * mapping at all; a zero means "no ports block" rather than port zero, so the
 * block is left out of the reviewed text entirely instead of being emitted
 * with a placeholder.
