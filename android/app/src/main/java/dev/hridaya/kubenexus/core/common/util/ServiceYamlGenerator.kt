/**
 * Renders the reviewed manifest for the guided Service creation flow as
 * deterministic YAML.
 *
 * The generated text is exactly what gets applied: the user reviews this
 * string, and the same string is sent through the bridge, so what is shown is
 * never out of sync with what is created. The manifest is assembled as an
 * ordered structure and serialized by yamlkt's dynamic block-style encoder,
 * which preserves key order instead of relying on hand-appended lines.
 * [ServiceDraft.selectorApp] intentionally targets the `app` label the
 * Deployment generator stamps onto its pods, so a Service created this way
 * routes traffic to that workload even when the Service's own name differs
 * from it.
