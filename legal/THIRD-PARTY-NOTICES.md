## 2. Kubernetes client libraries

KubeNexus's Go core (`k8s-engine/`) is built on the official Kubernetes Go
client libraries.

### 2.1 No fork — client-go is consumed unmodified from upstream

`k8s-engine/go.mod` depends on `k8s.io/client-go` directly. No source file from the module has
been modified, which was verified on 26 September 2026: a personal mirror of the repository was
compared tag-for-tag against upstream and resolved to the same commit
(`7a46b3e8b7afc2ae403f4ff7deaa5d10bb727073`) with zero commits of its own.

Consequences:

- Apache-2.0 §4(b) — the duty to mark modified files — does not arise, and cannot arise while
  there is no fork.
- The build does not depend on any personal GitHub account, so it cannot be broken by a repository
  being deleted, renamed, or suspended, and a floating tag cannot be swapped for modified code.
- `go get -u`, Dependabot and `govulncheck` behave normally.

Verified after the change: `go list -m k8s.io/client-go` resolves to `k8s.io/client-go v0.36.3`,
`go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` are clean, `gomobile bind` regenerates `kubenexus.aar`, and
the release APK builds.

### 2.2 Patch currency

KubeNexus pins the `v0.36.3` **release tag**, which is immutable, so there is no silent drift.
Patch level does not advance on its own, though — track
[k8s.io/client-go releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/releases) and bump
deliberately.

One upstream merge shortly after this pin referenced `fix-cve-2026-78662`, which bumps
`golang.org/x/crypto` to v0.56.0. **This does not affect KubeNexus:**
`golang.org/x/crypto` does not appear in `k8s-engine/go.mod` or `go.sum`, so it is not in the
verified build graph. Re-check if you later add a dependency that pulls it in.

### 2.3 Trademark note

Apache-2.0 §6 is explicit:

> *"This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
> service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
> reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
> reproducing the content of the NOTICE file."*

So the Apache License gives you **no** right to the word "Kubernetes". The name
is a **registered trademark of LF Projects, LLC**, governed by a separate
trademark policy. See [TRADEMARK-NOTICE.md](TRADEMARK-NOTICE.md) §1 — this is the
single highest-risk item in this document.

## 3. Native packages present in the tree but not attributed here

`terminal-native/zig-pkg/` also contains `translate_c`, `uucode`, `aro`, `wuffs`, `zlib`, `pixels`,
`nerd_fonts_symbols_only`, and `afl++` under Ghostty's `pkg/`.

These are **not dependencies KubeNexus introduces.** Zig resolved them transitively through
`.ghostty`, and each was fetched from `deps.files.ghostty.org` — Ghostty's own dependency host.
Their licensing is Ghostty's to discharge, under its MIT licence and its `build.zig.zon`. See
[§4.2](#42-why-only-two-hand-declared-components) for the dependency trace and the binary
evidence.

Two things worth keeping in mind even though nothing is owed to a user for them:

- **`afl++` is GPL-2.0.** It sits inside Ghostty's tree and is not linked into anything we build
  (no `afl` symbols in `libghostty_jni.so`). If a future Ghostty bump ever made it a linked
  dependency of the JNI library, the whole distribution would become GPL and could no longer be
  Apache-2.0. Worth a glance when bumping the Ghostty pin.
- **Nerd Fonts is `.lazy`** and absent from the binary (`nerd`, `woff2`, `ttf` all zero hits), so
  the SIL OFL's requirement to ship its text with the font files does not currently apply.

## 4. Transitive Go and Kotlin dependencies

### 4.1 In-app attribution (implemented)

KubeNexus renders this information in-app at **Settings → About → Open source licenses**, backed
by [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries) 15.2.0 (Apache-2.0). The Gradle
plugin collects licence metadata at build time into `res/raw/aboutlibraries`, and the app renders it
with a Material 3 `LibrariesContainer`.

This matters for a hard reason, not just convenience: Ghostty is statically linked native code, and
the MIT licence requires its notice to travel with every copy of the software. A notice that lives
only in this repository does **not** satisfy that. Verified present in a minified, resource-shrunk
release APK.

The metadata comes from two places, because Gradle only ever sees half of what ships:

| Source | Covers | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Gradle resolution | Android/JVM artifacts | automatic |
| `android/config/libraries/` | Ghostty and the Kubernetes Go client | hand-declared |

### 4.2 Why only two hand-declared components

`terminal-native/build.zig.zon` declares exactly one dependency:

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .ghostty = .{
        .url = "git+https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty#683d8db...",
```

Everything else under `zig-pkg/` — `translate_c`, `uucode`, `aro`, `wuffs`, `zlib`, `pixels`,
`nerd_fonts_symbols_only` — was resolved transitively by Zig, and every one is fetched from
`deps.files.ghostty.org`, Ghostty's own dependency host. `afl++` lives inside Ghostty's own `pkg/`
directory. Nerd Fonts and the rest are additionally marked `.lazy`, so they are not built for the
Android target at all.

None of that is a dependency we introduce, so it is not re-attributed here. Ghostty's own MIT
licence and its `build.zig.zon` govern its closure. Declaring a component we merely inherited would
misattribute it and add rows a user cannot act on.

Confirmed empirically against the shipped `libghostty_jni.so` (statically linked, only `libc.so`
dynamic): `ghostty`, `WuffsError`/`wuffs_swizzler` and `BadZlibHeader`/`WrongZlibChecksum` are
present; `nerd`, `woff2`, `ttf`, `uucode`, `translate_c` and `afl` are all absent. The components
that are built are covered by Ghostty's attribution.

`golang.org/x/mobile` is our own build tool (gobind, used to expose the Go core to Kotlin). It is
BSD-3-Clause, used at build time and never distributed, so nothing is owed to a user for it.

### 4.3 The one hand-supplied licence text

`android/config/licenses/` holds a single file. MIT is the only licence in play whose SPDX text
cannot be used as-is: the body carries a literal `Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holders>`
placeholder, and the licence requires the project's *actual* copyright notice. Shipping the
template would satisfy nothing. So the canonical body is stored with the real notice filled in and
`"spdxId": "MIT"` declared, which is what makes the app show and colour-code it as plain
**MIT License** rather than a KubeNexus-branded variant.

Everything else — Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, CC0-1.0, OFL-1.1, Zlib, GPL-2.0-only — resolves by
SPDX id, and AboutLibraries fetches the canonical text from spdx.org at build time.

**When you add a dependency that ships code, add its entry to `config/libraries/` and, if it is
MIT- or BSD-licensed, its copyright line to `config/licenses/`.** `strictMode = FAIL` in
`app/build.gradle.kts` will stop a release for an unreviewed licence id, but it cannot tell you a
copyright notice is missing.

A known limitation: `BSD-3-Clause` still shows the SPDX template for Gradle-resolved dependencies
that use it. That is AboutLibraries' behaviour for third-party POMs and is outside this repo's
control.

### 4.4 Known configuration hazard

`app/build.gradle.kts` pins `kotlin-stdlib` back to 2.2.10 via `resolutionStrategy.force`.
AboutLibraries 15.2.0 is published against stdlib 2.4.10, which the Kotlin 2.2.10 compiler cannot
read; without the pin the module fails to compile. The block is commented in place. It is version
skew, not a fix — remove it when the project's Kotlin version moves to 2.4.x.

### 4.5 Kotlin / Android dependencies (first-party, no third-party SDKs)

Every declared dependency resolves to Google/Jetpack first-party artifacts:
AndroidX (Core, Lifecycle, Activity, Navigation, Room, DataStore, Compose,
Material3, Adaptive, Window Size Class), Kotlin stdlib/coroutines/serialization,
Hilt (Apache-2.0), LeakCanary (Apache-2.0, **debug-only — verify it is not in the
release variant**), `net.mamoe.yamlkt`, `org.json`, `javax.inject`.

**No advertising, analytics, or crash-reporting SDKs are present.** This is worth
keeping true: it is what makes the Data safety form in
[PRIVACY-POLICY.md](PRIVACY-POLICY.md) Appendix A simple, and it is a genuine
differentiator. Adding one SDK will invalidate that table.

### 4.6 Generating a compliance export

For an auditor, or for a Play review, produce a checkable report:

```bash
make licenses                          # -> legal/compliance/
make licenses LICENSES_DIR=/tmp/out    # anywhere else
make licenses-clean
```

It prints the library count, the distinct licences in use, every native component, and — the part
that actually needs a human — the contents of the report's `ARTIFACTS WITHOUT LICENSE` and
`UNKNOWN LICENSES` sections, which should both be empty. `LICENSES_DIR` accepts a relative or
absolute path, and the target fails rather than reporting success if no report was written.

Nothing here is committed. The report is derived entirely from the build, and the licences that
actually ship come from `res/raw/aboutlibraries`, which the plugin generates during the Android
build — not from this export. Regenerating it whenever you want it keeps dependency bumps from
producing a diff of generated files. The output is renamed to `kubenexus-licenses.txt` and
`.csv` so a copy that travels on its own still says what it is.

## 5. Outstanding obligations

| # | Obligation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Root `LICENSE` for KubeNexus itself | **Done** — `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0 + trademark reservation) |
| 2 | Root `NOTICE` file | **Done** — `NOTICE` |
| 3 | `legal/LICENSE-Apache-2.0.txt` | **Done** — verbatim Apache-2.0 |
| 4 | Ghostty MIT text reachable in the shipped binary | **Done + verified in a release APK** (§4.1) |
| 5 | Per-file modification notices in the `client-go` fork (§4(b)) | **Not required** — fork verified unmodified (§2.1) |
| 6 | Remove the no-op `replace` from `k8s-engine/go.mod` | **Done** — depends on upstream directly (§2.1) |
| 7 | Confirm `afl++` is never linked into a shipped `.so` | **Done** — no `afl` symbols in `libghostty_jni.so`; see the CI check below |
| 8 | Confirm LeakCanary is excluded from the release variant | **Unverified** — it is behind `debugImplementation`, so correct today |
| 9 | Declare a newly shipped native dependency in `config/libraries/` | **Manual** — see §4.3 |
| 10 | Produce an audit report on demand | **Done** — `make licenses` (§4.6); output is not committed |

### On obligation 7

`afl++` is GPL-2.0 and sits inside Ghostty's tree. It is a fuzzing harness and must never be linked
into a library we ship. Nothing in the licence screen declares it any more, because it is not our
dependency, so this CI check is the only safeguard:

```bash
# Fail if a GPL-licensed symbol ends up in a shipped .so
for so in android/app/src/main/jniLibs/*/*.so k8s-engine/kubenexus.aar; do
  strings "$so" 2>/dev/null | grep -qE 'afl_|__afl_' && { echo "GPL code linked into $so"; exit 1; }
done
```

### On obligation 4

MIT requires the notice "be included in all copies or substantial portions of the
Software." Ghostty is statically linked native code inside your AAB, so the
notice must be reachable by the person using the app — not only in your Git
repository. A settings screen such as **Settings → About → Open source licenses**
that renders this file satisfies that. Most developers discover this only when a
Play reviewer or a user asks.

## 6. Verifying before you ship

```bash
# Ghostty and vendored Zig deps are present and pinned
ls terminal-native/zig-pkg/ | grep -i ghostty

# Confirm the pinned Ghostty commit still matches build.zig.zon
grep -A2 'ghostty' terminal-native/build.zig.zon

# Confirm client-go is consumed straight from upstream, with no fork redirect
grep -n 'replace' k8s-engine/go.mod || echo "no replace directives"
go -C k8s-engine list -m k8s.io/client-go

# Confirm no ad/analytics SDK crept in
grep -rniE 'firebase|play-services-ads|crashlytics|mixpanel|appsflyer|adjust|amplitude|sentry' \
  android/gradle/libs.versions.toml android/**/*.kts || echo "clean"
```
